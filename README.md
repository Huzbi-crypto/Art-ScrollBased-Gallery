# Introduction

This is an attempt to create a perspective based scrolling of some artworks grabbed from the internet. This is inspired from [Inflection](https://inflection.xyz/) by [Obys](https://obys.agency/).

So, in the end, I had to ask help from GSAP, scrolltrigger, lenis for the scrolling animations because I realized that doing it manually would've made me get a mental checkup.

Even so, at the moment, I've tried to make a feeble attempt to imitate the design. This project might get improved as time moves on, who knows.
